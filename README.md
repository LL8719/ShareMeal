## *Description*  
<br>
<br>

As passionate food lovers, we created SHAREMEAL as an application that allows the user to create and share meal recipes with others.  

We are constantly exploring new flavors, experimenting with ingredients, and creating unique dishes that we would love to share with a  

community of like-minded individuals.  We envision an application that makes recipe creation and sharing effortless.



<br>
<br>

## *Technologies*  
<br>

Technologies used are React, Chakra UI, Bootstrap, Pexels Photocommunity, Raleway Fonts, React-Icons on the front end.  

GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.  

MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

JWT was used for authentication.

## *Instructions*  
<br>  

To view the site, navigate to the URL link to our Heroku deployed application provided below.  

On the navbar select the option to `Login/Signup`.  

When form loads, select `Signup` at the top.  

Input username of choice, an email address and password of 8 characters minimum.  

After authentication, the user gains access to options to create, update, save and delete recipes.
